Waypoint System: This system is designed to create bots/multiple offline players riding the bicycle along with the player on the map. It is essentially a replay/ghosting system with real-time physics.

How to Use:

Step 1: Select Record from the recording state drop-down in the inspector for the bicycle.
Step 2: Enter the Play Mode and ride your bicycle around for a few seconds.
Step 3: Select the bicycle controller GameObject in the hierarchy while in the Play Mode and go to Window > Save Bicycle Replay.
Step 4: Exit out of the Play Mode and go to Window > Load Bicycle Replay
Step 5: Change the recording state to Playback and enter play mode to test it out.
Please Note: The replay is frame-rate dependent so please record with V-Sync on and play it back with the same.
